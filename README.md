# Add Auto Download Link into WordPress Menu

<h3>For .jpg, .png Images</h3>
<p>Make sure the image you want to provide for download is already uploaded to your WordPress media library.</p>
Create a Custom Link in the Menu:

<h3>Go to your WordPress dashboard</h3>
<li>Navigate to "Appearance" -> "Menus."</li>
<li>Create a new menu or edit an existing one.</li>
<li>Add a custom link to your menu by clicking on the "Custom Links" tab.</li>
<li>In the URL field, enter the file URL or the URL of the media attachment page (you can find this in the media library when you click on the image).</li>
<li>In the Link Text field, you can enter the text you want to display for the download link.</li>
<li>After adding the custom link, look for an option called <b>"Link Relationship (XFN)"</b> in the <b>menu settings</b> This might be hidden, so you may need to enable it from the <b>"Screen Options"</b> tab at the top of the menu page.</li>
<li>In the "Link Relationship (XFN)" field, enter the word <b>"download".</b></li>
<li>Save the menu.</li>
<br>
<b><i>*Keep in mind that this may not work consistently across all browsers, and some browsers might open the file instead of triggering a download.</i></b>

<h3>Alternative Approach - Using .zip file</h3>
<li>Create a .zip of the file you want to auto-download.</li>
<li>Then follow the steps before mentioned.</li>
